In today's cloud-native landscape, monitoring and observability are crucial for maintaining healthy Kubernetes clusters. This post covers how to build a comprehensive monitoring stack that provides metrics, logs, and traces across your entire infrastructure.

## The Three Pillars of Observability

When building a monitoring stack, we focus on three key pillars:

1. **Metrics** - Quantitative measurements over time
2. **Logs** - Discrete events and records
3. **Traces** - Request flow through distributed systems

## Core Components

### Prometheus for Metrics Collection

Prometheus serves as the backbone for metrics collection in our Kubernetes environment:

```yaml
# prometheus-values.yaml
prometheus:
  prometheusSpec:
    retention: 30d
    storageSpec:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          storageClassName: fast-ssd
          accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 50Gi
```

### Grafana for Visualization

Grafana provides rich dashboards and alerting capabilities:

```yaml
grafana:
  adminPassword: your-secure-password
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    storageClassName: fast-ssd
    size: 10Gi
  datasources:
    datasources.yaml:
      apiVersion: 1
      datasources:
      - name: Prometheus
        type: prometheus
        url: http://prometheus:9090
      - name: Loki
        type: loki
        url: http://loki:3100
```

### Loki for Log Aggregation

Loki efficiently handles log storage and querying:

```bash
# Deploy Loki stack
helm upgrade --install loki grafana/loki-stack \
  --namespace monitoring \
  --values loki-values.yaml
```

## OpenTelemetry Integration

OpenTelemetry provides vendor-neutral telemetry collection:

```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
spec:
  config: |
    receivers:
      otlp:
        protocols:
          grpc:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
          http:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
    
    processors:
      batch:
    
    exporters:
      prometheus:
        endpoint: "0.0.0.0:8889"
      loki:
        endpoint: http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push
    
    service:
      pipelines:
        metrics:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [prometheus]
        logs:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [loki]
```

## Key Monitoring Patterns

### 1. Application Metrics
- RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration)
- USE metrics (Utilization, Saturation, Errors)
- Business metrics

### 2. Infrastructure Monitoring
- Node-level metrics
- Pod resource usage
- Network performance
- Storage metrics

### 3. Service Mesh Observability
When using Istio, leverage built-in telemetry:

```yaml
apiVersion: telemetry.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: Telemetry
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  metrics:
  - providers:
    - name: prometheus
  - providers:
    - name: otel
```

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Planning**: Allocate sufficient resources for monitoring stack
2. **Retention Policies**: Balance storage costs with data retention needs
3. **Alert Fatigue**: Design meaningful alerts, avoid noise
4. **Security**: Secure monitoring endpoints and data access
5. **High Availability**: Deploy monitoring stack in HA configuration

## Next Steps

In upcoming posts, we'll dive deeper into:
- Custom Prometheus metrics and recording rules
- Advanced Grafana dashboard design
- Log parsing and structured logging
- Distributed tracing patterns

Building a robust monitoring stack is an iterative process. Start with the basics and gradually enhance your observability as your systems grow in complexity.
